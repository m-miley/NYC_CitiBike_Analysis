### Story 1

Story 1 Walks us through "Where?", "Who?, "When?", and "What Age?" questions identifying the customer base and their riding habbits and patterns.

- First up, we see a high concentration of activity near Downtown Manhattan where there is booming economy and tourism.  Filtered to show only stations with at least 5,000 rides to help dashboard filter functionality.

**Subscriber and Gender Breakdown in Ride Count, Percent, and Avg Trip Duration**

- Next, we get a clear view of which genders are using our resources in exact proportions and for how long they ride.  Male Subscribers do a majority of the riding at 58.1 percent, however, Females generally spend more time per trip.
<br>
**Peak Hours by User Type and Weekend vs. Weekday**

- Here it's easy to see how riding patterns for our users by time of day comparing weekends to weekdays.  For Subscribers, throughout the workweek, have a very clear spike in usage during commuting hours and relatively calm and spread out activity through the weekend.  Customers on the other hand, steadily increase their riding as the hours of the day progress up to 5pm before declining during the weekdays.  Contrarily, on the weekend, their activity doesn't decline but we see more riding earlier in the day with the peak 11am - 5pm.
<br>
**Overall Weekly Activity by Hour**

- Similar information is conveyed in the Highlight table showing the significance for resource availability during weekday commuting hours and most of the day Saturday.  Clearly, any attempts at maintenance should be scheduled outside of peak hours.

**Birth Year Subscriber Histogram**
![Screen Shot 2022-06-25 at 5 52 56 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100544761/175792685-64ec9eae-0640-4f76-9ec5-1dde3a83d6f8.png)
- To better understand our user base, we can clearly see that the largest subscriber groups are born between 1980-1995.  
<br>
**Trip Duration by Birth Year**
![Screen Shot 2022-06-25 at 5 56 09 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100544761/175792752-443fa354-4d91-4eda-9bbc-402fae09b7eb.png)
- This visualization shows the trip duration patterns per age group.  The outlier at 1965 is because it's the default birth year programmed in for single use customers without an age input.  Average Trip Duration is 17.5 minutes.
